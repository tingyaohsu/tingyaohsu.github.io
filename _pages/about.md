Hello! I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate at PennState University working on v2l & figure captioning + NLP + HCI. I am fortunate to be advised by Dr. [Ting-hao (Kenneth) Huang](https://crowd.ist.psu.edu) and Dr. [C. Lee Giles](https://clgiles.ist.psu.edu). Prior to Penn State, I received B.S. in CS from [National Tsing Hua University](https://eecs-en.site.nthu.edu.tw). Before Ph.D., I spent great time working with Dr. [Shang-Hong Lai](http://www.cs.nthu.edu.tw/~lai/) in CVLAB and Dr. [Yuan-Hao Chang (Johnson Chang)](https://homepage.iis.sinica.edu.tw/~johnson/index.php?SelectedItem=&SelectedGroup=&SelectedSubGroup=) in [Academia Sinica](https://www.sinica.edu.tw/en).

My research lies in the intersection of vision-and-language and HCI. I am particularly interested in multimodal learning, specifically in vision and language tasks. Currently focusing on vision-to-language generation. My goal is to bridge the gap between vision and language and build AI systems that can be applied on social media platforms, writing/reading support, and increase accessibility for people. I am also interested in language-related tasks, such as data-to-text generation and QA summarization.
