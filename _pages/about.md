Hello! I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate at Penn State University working across Vision-to-Language, NLP, and HCI. I am fortunate to be advised by Dr. [Ting-hao (Kenneth) Huang](https://crowd.ist.psu.edu) and Dr. [C. Lee Giles](https://clgiles.ist.psu.edu). Prior to Penn State, I received B.S. in CS from [National Tsing Hua University](https://eecs-en.site.nthu.edu.tw). Before Ph.D., I spent great time working with Dr. [Shang-Hong Lai](http://www.cs.nthu.edu.tw/~lai/) in CVLAB and Dr. [Yuan-Hao Chang (Johnson Chang)](https://homepage.iis.sinica.edu.tw/~johnson/index.php?SelectedItem=&SelectedGroup=&SelectedSubGroup=) in [Academia Sinica](https://www.sinica.edu.tw/en).

My research goal is to develop interactive and intelligent systems that enhance everyday human activities. Currently, I am focusing on tasks that integrate vision and language, involving understanding, generation, and evaluation through multimodal learning and Large Language Models (LLMs). I am also interested in improving multimodal/LLM agents and alignment to optimize human-machine interactions.

<span style="color: red;">I am currently on the job market and looking for full-time industry positions.</span>.
